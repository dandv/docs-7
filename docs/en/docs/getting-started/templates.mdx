# Templates

Extension.js allows you to create new browser extensions quickly by using templates. Templates provide pre-built structures, components, and configurations that fit various needs and technologies. By using the `--template` flag, you can select the one that best suits your project requirements.

## Available Templates

<CarouselTemplates />

## How Does It Work?

When you run the `create` command with the `--template` flag, Extension.js fetches the template from the repository and generates the project structure based on the template. This process includes installing dependencies, setting up configurations, and creating the necessary files for the extension.

## More templates

You can find a list of all officially supported templates [here](https://github.com/extension-js/extension.js/tree/main/examples). Their folder name is the template param name like so, `--template=<folder_name>`.

## Best Practices

- Use templates to bootstrap your project quickly and efficiently.
- Start using templates with technology stacks you are familiar with.
- Choose the browser extension context that best fits your project requirements.

## Next Steps

- Understand [Browser Runners](../browsers/browsers-available) and how they help you visualize your extension.
- Learn how Extension.js handles [Environment Variables](../features/environment-variables).
